# Methods

**Corpus:** 8 paraphrastic snippets (4 Godot-like dialog passages; 4 Notes-like monologues) with `id, work, year, voice, text`.
**Processing:** tokenization; metrics: token count, type-token ratio, naive sentiment (demo lexicon).
**Themes:** lexicon-based hits for `outward` (quest) and `inward` (introspection).
**Extra Feature:** dialogicity measure (dialog vs monologue) as a proxy for outward vs inward orientation.
**Visualisation:** per-work charts, theme hits, top keywords, and a global co-occurrence network.
