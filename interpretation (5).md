# Interpretation — Outward Quest vs Inward Descent

**Claim:** *Waiting for Godot* frames meaning as an **external arrival** (a messenger, an awaited sign), sustained by ritual and dialogue; *Notes from Underground* treats meaning as an **internal corrosion** and assertion of will, voiced through solitary confession.

- **Godot (outward):** waiting, ritual, shared language as a way to keep the world from collapsing.
- **Notes (inward):** refusal, self-contradiction, and hyper-consciousness as sources of pain and agency.
- **Why answers stay elusive:** because the human search splits — one path waits for certainty **from outside**, the other devours certainty **from within**.
